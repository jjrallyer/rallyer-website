        <h1>Rallyer</h1>
        <p>
    We bring together two rare things:<br>
    - Extensive leadership experience leading and managing successful election campaigns targeting over 50 million voters.<br>
    - A decade of management consulting and product-building experience at McKinsey and Gojek.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>We believe</strong><br>
    A volunteer base that is engaged months before an election can be mobilized during the campaign and is necessary to display your strength for fundraising and ultimately win the election.
